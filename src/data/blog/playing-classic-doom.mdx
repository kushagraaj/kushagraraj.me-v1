## Downloading the Game Files
Before diving in and learning how to play, you'll need to gather a few game files such as IWADS and WADS, as well as zandronum in order to run the game. A brief explanation of IWADS, WADS, and Zandronum

- IWADS - You can't accomplish anything without the iwads, which are the primary game files.
- WADS - WADS are basically user-created mods for doom owing to their flexible source code.
- Zandronum - Zandronum is a launcher for doom games because you can't run them on today's beast hardware, hence you'll have to utilise Zandronum.

## Download Links

### Zandronum
- [Zandronum](https://zandronum.com/download), You can make your selection based on your operating system and architecture. If you have Windows, simply download the first link.
